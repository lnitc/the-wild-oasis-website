# The Wild Oasis üèïÔ∏è

Welcome to The Wild Oasis, a full-stack web application for browsing and managing reservations for luxury cabins in Italy. This project demonstrates a modern web development stack using Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend.

## ¬©Ô∏è Acknowledgements

This project is based on a training app as part of [The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**. All credit for the original architecture, design patterns, and sample code goes to the course author.  This repository is solely for my personal learning and practice.


## ‚ú® About The Project

The Wild Oasis is a demonstration project where users can explore beautiful, isolated cabins, check their availability, and make reservations. Authenticated users can manage their personal profiles and view or modify their upcoming stays. The entire experience is designed to be seamless and intuitive.

This application is built with the **Next.js App Router** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. User authentication is handled by **Auth.js (NextAuth)**, and all data, including user info, cabins, and reservations, is stored and managed in a **Supabase** database.
